### Notes and todo, the way you want.
[Follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/codingwithburak)  
Darkwrite is a simple and easy way to organize your notes and todos. 
### Customization beyond expectations
The look and feel is very tweakable. You can change the color theme as well as the user interface font. You can also add a wallpaper if you want to. You can change the font of each note individually as well.
### Your todos right by your side
Todos are displayed on a sidebar, and you can drag them around as you wish.
### Cross platform
The application is built on web technologies and Rust, which makes it possible to run the app on Windows, Linux and macOS.
# Development Status
The application is currently unstable and subject to breaking changes with every commit. I'm currently doing some design changes, which will significantly change the way the application works. All features except for search have been ported from the Electron version to the Tauri rewrite. 
Feel free to create an issue if you have any suggestions :)
