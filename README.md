### Notes and todo, the way you want.
[Follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/codingwithburak)  
Darkwrite is a simple and easy way to organize your notes and todos. 
### Customization beyond expectations
The look and feel is very tweakable. You can change the color theme as well as the user interface font. You can also add a wallpaper if you want to. You can change the font of each note individually as well.
### Your todos right by your side
Todos are displayed on a sidebar, and you can drag them around as you wish.
### Cross platform
The application is built on web technologies and Rust, which makes it possible to run the app on Windows, Linux and macOS.
### Every note is unique
Your notes will be the most colorful and the most enjoyable to look at. Change the colors and the font of your notes individually, making all of them your own.
### Organize your notes with notebooks
You can easily move your notes to another notebook, or create a new one, by right clicking your notes.

# Development Status
Darkwrite is currently extremely unstable as it is undergoing an UI redesign, works for implementing rich text editing and possibly many backend changes.
Feel free to create an issue if you have any suggestions :)
