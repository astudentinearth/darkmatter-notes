Darkwrite is a simple and easy way to organize your notes and todos.

## Development Status
Darkwrite is currently under active development and not even alpha-ready. It's not in a usable state yet. Star this repository so you will know when a release is out.  
Older release tags are outdated and are nothing like what is currently being developed.

# Building
Build system might not work as intended right now.  
See [BUILDING.md](docs/BUILDING.md) for more information.  
See [DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) to see how you can run Darkwrite right now to test it for yourself.
