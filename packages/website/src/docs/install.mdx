> Windows 10 and 11 are supported. Older Windows versions are not supported.

Download the latest release from [our releases page.](https://github.com/astudentinearth/darkwrite/releases)  
When you run the installer, you may see a "Windows protected your PC" dialog. This is because our installers are unsigned (and code signing certificates are costly). Click "More info" and then choose "Run anyway"
