Darkwrite developer console
This console is used for testing backend code during development, I don't recommend you mess here :)
The output displayed will be gone if you leave this page.

help - Displays this message
ListNotebooks - Lists all notebook IDs and names
ListAllNotes - Lists all notes (regardless of notebook)
Search <query> - Tests search algorithm. (Actually you test it yourself.) Everything after the command is part of the query, no need to replace spaces with %20

All parameters beyond this point must have spaces replaced with %20 for the parser to work.
CreateNotebook <name> - Creates a new notebook with a random ID
DeleteNotebook <id> - Nukes a notebook with everything inside
ListNoteHeaders <notebook id> - Lists note IDs and titles in a notebook
RenameNotebook <id> <new name> - Renames a notebook
