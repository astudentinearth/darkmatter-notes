# Darkmatter Notes
Simplified note taking app. No unnecessary features. Customizable by editing the CSS.

# How do I customize it ??
No UI front-end for customizing is here - yet. But, you can edit the following JSON files to change several properties.
`colors_dark.json` and `colors_light.json`: Edit the colors. Only background and text color (for now).
`~/.local/share/darkmatter-notes/settings.json`: This file contains the corner radius for elements. Also stores the color scheme name. Don't set it to anything other than `"dark"` or `"light"`.


Under development stage. Expect bugs and lack of features.

How do i run this?
First, use `npm install electron`
Then run it using `electron .`
